about: |
    Developer Advocate at appear.in. He is the youngest and most enthusiastic
    member of the team. He is an idealist at heart, and has previously been the
    Head of IT for the biggest international student festival in the world. He
    enjoys talking (sometimes perhaps a bit too much), and especially in front
    of a willing crowd. Can often be seen roaming the candy cabinet at work.
