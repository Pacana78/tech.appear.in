about: |
    Thomas started playing with WebRTC while working on his master thesis in
    2013, where he managed to use the technology to perform phone calls from
    the browser. When the appear.in project was handed over from the interns,
    Thomas was quick to secure a place on the team. Originally a Python guy in
    university, he has moved on to embrace JavaScript. Currently juggling iOS,
    backend, web frontend and anything else that grabs his attention.
